# pdf2wordGUI
Graphical user interface that allows you to select a pdf file, hit one button, and convert it to a word file in the same directory. You don't have to download the whole code base, I'd reccomend just downloading this file, and then follow the instructions below.

REQUIREMENTS: run brackets in a terminal {win + R, cmd}
- Python 3.x (Windows: winget install Python.Python, Mac: brew install python)
- Conversion Dependecy Pakage (pip install pdf2docx, if that doesn't work: pip3 install pdf2docx)

To run the program:
directly from terminal: Python3 path/to/wherever/you/saved/this/script 

OR

Open the file in Python IDLE / VS Code and run it from there. 


# pdf2wordCLI
Accepts a file path to a pdf, converts it to a word file in the same directory, works on Mac OS and Windows locally keeping sensitive information secure. 

REQUIREMENTS: same as above

To run the program: same as above 

Future considerations: Creating an executable file with pyinstaller.
